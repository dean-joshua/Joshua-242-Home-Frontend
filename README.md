# Joshua Dean's Personal Site

This is the code for the frontend of my personal site. It was developed using React and React-Bootstrap. On the back-end I am using an express.js server with mongoDB. All data is being loaded in dynamically from my REST api.

## Tools

- VSCode
- React.js
- React-bootstrap
- React-router-dom
- React-router-bootstrap

## How it was built(Notes for future projects)

- Create a new react app with the terminal commmand `npx creat-react-app [your app name]`
- Install packages: `npm install --save react-bootstrap react-router-dom`
- Create a components folder in your src directory(this is where the individual components for your pages will live)
- Create a pages folder in your src directory(this is where your different site pages will live)
- Create an img folder for any images your plan to not load in from your API
- Start building your components!
